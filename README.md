✨ Just completed my very first internship task! ✨

I created a product promotion post for Ralph Lauren Romance Rosé fragrance — focusing on balance, typography, color harmony, and composition. 💫

This project helped me practice designing a visually appealing ad that not only highlights the product but also reflects the brand’s elegance while driving attention with a clear CTA (Shop Now). 🛍️

To add more value, I’ve also put together a step-by-step tutorial sharing my design process — from initial concept to the final touches. 🎨

I’m truly grateful to 💼 Rhombix Technologies for this amazing opportunity to sharpen my skills and grow as a designer. 🌸
